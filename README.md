# AWS S3 File Uploader

This Python script allows you to easily upload files to an Amazon S3 bucket using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **AWS Account**: You'll need an AWS account. If you don't have one, you can [sign up for AWS here](https://aws.amazon.com/).

2. **AWS IAM User**: Create an IAM (Identity and Access Management) user in your AWS account with the necessary permissions to interact with S3. Make sure to generate and securely store your IAM user's access key ID and secret access key.

3. **Python**: Ensure you have Python installed on your local machine. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).


**Boto3**: Install the Boto3 library, the official AWS SDK for Python, using pip:
pip install boto3


## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aws-s3-file-uploader.git

2. Change to the project directory:
cd aws-s3-file-uploader
typescript

3. Open the `s3_file_uploader.py` script and edit the following variables:
- `file_to_upload`: Set this to the path of the file you want to upload.
- `bucket_name`: Set this to the name of your AWS S3 bucket.
- `object_name`: Set this to the desired object name in your S3 bucket (the uploaded file's name).
  
4. Run the script:
python s3_file_uploader.py

This will upload the specified file to your AWS S3 bucket.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the script:

```python
file_to_upload = "example.txt"  # Change this to the file you want to upload
bucket_name = "your-s3-bucket-name"  # Change this to your S3 bucket name
object_name = file_to_upload

upload_file_to_s3(file_to_upload, bucket_name, object_name)
